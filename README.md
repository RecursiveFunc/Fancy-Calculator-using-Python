The user interface is enhanced with smooth hover effects and number formatting with commas and decimals.

*Features*
Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
Percentage calculation (%)
Square root calculation (√)
Number formatting (commas for thousands, decimal support)
Hover effects for buttons
Clean and minimal UI with dynamic button styling
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
locale for number formatting
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fancy-calculator.git
cd fancy-calculator
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

If Tkinter is not installed, you can install it (though it is generally included with Python by default):

On Windows: Tkinter comes bundled with Python, so no need for installation.

On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
How to Use
Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
Use the on-screen buttons to perform arithmetic operations.

Enter numbers and press +, -, *, or / for operations.
Press = to get the result.
Use C to clear the input field.
You can calculate percentages and square roots with the % and √ buttons.
Numbers are formatted with commas for thousands and can handle decimal points.
